# Databases
{: .no_toc }
 
Every application needs a place to store data from users, devices, and the application itself. Databases are important backend systems that are used to store, manage, update, and analyze data for all types of applications, from small back-office systems to mobile and consumer web applications with global scale.

Build use case-driven, highly scalable, distributed applications suited to your specific needs. AWS offers 15+ purpose-built engines to support diverse data models, including relational, key-value, document, in-memory, graph, time series, wide column, and ledger databases.
