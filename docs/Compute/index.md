# Compute
 
AWS offers the broadest and deepest functionality for compute. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offers granular control for managing your infrastructure with the choice of processors, storage, and networking. AWS container services offer the best choice and flexibility of services to run your containers. AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events from more than 150 natively integrated AWS and software as a service (SaaS) sources.

AWS provides multiple ways to build, deploy, and get to market quickly on the latest technology. The AWS Nitro System, exclusive to AWS, enables us to rapidly innovate, which means youâ€™re always building on the latest technologies. Get started quickly with Amazon Lightsail, a virtual private server for a low, predictable price, and serverless computing with AWS Lambda.

With AWS compute you pay only for the instance or resource you need, for as long as you use it, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. We offer automated recommendations to help you improve price performance as well as tools and innovative pricing models to further optimize costs. With EC2 Spot Instances you can save up to 90 percent over on-demand pricing for instances, or with Savings Plans you can save up to 72 percent across instances, containers, and serverless on a single bill.
