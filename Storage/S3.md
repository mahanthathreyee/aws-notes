- Global service
	- Unique name for bucket across all regions in account
	- Buckets are defined on a region level
- Max object size: `5 TB`

## Bucket Versioning
- Enabled on bucket level
- Protects against unintended deletes
- Allows to restore between version
- Suspending version does not delete older version (doesn't create new ones)
- Deletion of version, set a delete marker on it. 
	- Deleting the marker will restore the object

## Encryption
- SSE-S3. Keys managed by S3
- SEE-KMS. Keys managed by KMS
- SSE-C. Keys managed by client. **HTTPS must be used**

## Static Website
- Enable CORS for site to be accessible
- Check bucket policy to make sure public access or reads by CloudFront

## MFA Delete
- Require MFA for permanent delete objects or suspend versioning
- **Requires versioning to be enabled**
- Can be only configured by root

## Replication
- Asynchronous replication
- Replicates with the same ID for objects
- Supports cross region and cross account
- **Versioning must be enabled**
- Delete markers are replicated
- **Permanent deletes are not replicated**
- Replication cannot be chained (1->2; 2->3; 1 -/>3)

## Pre-signed URL
- Default expiration is 1 hour
- Inherit permission of the user who generated it

## Storage Classes
- Standard
- Infrequent Access
	- Minimum duration 30 days
	- Types
		- Standard IA
		- One-zone IA
			- Lesser availability 
			- Data lost if AZ fails
- Glacier
	- Glacier Instant Retrieval
		- Minimum duration 90 days
	- Glacier Flexible Retrieval
		- Minimum duration 90 days
	- Glacier Deep Archive
		- Minimum duration 180 days
- Intelligent Tiering
	- Automatically switches between tiers based on usage
	- Small fee for analytics, tier switch is free

## Lifecycle Rules
- Transition action
- Expiration action
- S3 Analytics
	- Provides analytics to determine when to transition data into different storage classes
	- **Does not work for ONEZONE_IA & GLACIER**

## Performance
- Multi-part upload
	- Required for files with `5 GB`
- Byte-range fetches
	- Parallelize downloads request by fetching specific byte ranges in each request
- S3 Transfer Acceleration
	- Speed up **upload and download** for **large objects (>1GB)** for **global users**
	- Data is ingested at the nearest edge location and is transferred over AWS private network

## S3 Select
- Select a subset of data from S3 using **SQL queries** (**server-side filtering**)
- Less network cost
- Less CPU cost on the client-side

## Notification Event
- Targets
	- SNS topics
	- **SQS Standard** queues (not FIFO queues)
	- Lambda functions

## Requester Pays Buckets
- Requester pays the cost of the request and the data downloaded from the bucket. The bucket owner only pays for the storage.

## Object Lock
- WORM (Write Once Read Many) model
- **Governance mode**
    - Only **users with special permissions** can overwrite or delete the object version or alter its lock settings
- **Compliance mode**
    - A protected object version **cannot be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user**
    - The object's retention mode can’t be changed, and **the retention period can’t be shortened**
- **Glacier Vault Lock**
	- WORM (Write Once Read Many) model for Glacier
	- For compliance and data retention
